### run_Analysis.r File Description:

This script will perform the following steps on the UCI HAR Dataset downloaded from [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

- We merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Then we extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Descriptive activity names are used to name the activities in the data set
- Data set are appropriately labeled with descriptive activity names. 
- At last using the average of each variable for each activity and each subject we create a second independent tidy data set
